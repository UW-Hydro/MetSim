Input Specifications
====================
There are 3 required input data sources that must be specified in the
configuration file or dictionary. Note that it is possible for a single file to
be specified for all three sources, provided that it has all of the required
data. For examples of the data see the ``tests/data`` directory within the
MetSim code.

Input forcings
--------------
Specified as ``forcing`` in the configuration file. This can either be the path
to a NetCDF file, or the path to a directory containing ASCII or binary data (in
the VIC4 format). The input forcing data is used to provide the base forcing
variables. The required variable data is minimum daily temperature, maximum
daily temperature, and daily precipitation.

The variable names can be mapped via the configuration file in the ``forcing_vars``
section. For more information about how to set up your configuration file see
the :ref:`configuration` page.

Domain file
-----------
Specified as ``domain`` in the configuration file. The domain file provides
information about the domain MetSim is to be run over. It is required to be a
NetCDF file. The domain requires two variables to be valid.

First, is the ``mask`` variable, which provides information about which grid
cells are valid to run MetSim on. Values that specify grid cells which should be
processed are specified via a positive, finite number (one or greater). Cells
which MetSim should ignore can be given as 0 or ``NaN``.

Second, is the ``elev`` variable. This provides elevation data used for
calculation of solar geometry. It should be specified in meters, and only needs
to be given at sites which are marked to be processed via the ``mask`` variable.

It is important to ensure that all valid locations in ``mask`` have data in
``elev``.  Failure to ensure this will result in errors during runtime.

State file
----------
The state file provides information about the history of each of the grid cells
to be processed. There are four required variables.

The first two are daily minimum and daily maximum temperatures for the 90 days
preceeding the start date specified in the configuration file.  They should be
specified as ``t_min`` and ``t_max`` respectively. Similarly precipitation
should be given as ``prec``.  These variables are used to generate seasonal
averages which are used in the calculation of shortwave and longwave radiation.

Output Specifications
=====================
.. ATTENTION::
    The ``time`` coordinate in MetSim's output is local to the location of each cell unless the ``utc_offset`` is set to
    ``True``! This means that for a single time slice in the NetCDF file all locations along a parallel (same latitude)
    will have the same solar geometry at that time.

The output variables that are available are dependent on the time step being used.  There are two cases:

Daily Output
------------

When ``time_step`` is set to 1440 in the configuration file, daily values are
generated. The following variables are available for output at a daily time
step:

* ``t_min`` : Minimum temperature (also a required input value) (C)
* ``t_max`` : Maximum temperature (also a required input value) (C)
* ``prec`` : Precipitation (also a required input value) (mm/day)
* ``vapor_pressure`` : Vapor pressure (kPa)
* ``shortwave`` : Shortwave radiation (W/m^2)
* ``tskc`` : Cloud cover fraction
* ``pet`` : Potential evapotranpiration (mm/day)
* ``wind`` : Wind speed (only if given as an input) (m/s)

Sub-daily Output
----------------

* ``temp`` : Temperature (C)
* ``prec`` : Precipitation (mm/timestep)
* ``shortwave`` : Shortwave radiation (W/m^2)
* ``vapor_pressure`` : Vapor pressure (kPa)
* ``air_pressure`` : Air pressure (kPa)
* ``rel_humid`` : Relative humidity
* ``spec_humid`` : Specific humidity
* ``longwave`` : Longwave radiation (W/m^2)
* ``tsck`` : Cloud cover fraction
* ``wind`` : Wind speed (only if given as an input) (m/s)
